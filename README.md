### Problem : 

Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.

### Solution:

Diabetes Prediction and proper medical procedures to cure it. The medical show is of the Doctors'. But as Engineers, we can take the first step, i.e. prediction.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the onset of diabetes or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors. 
We have also included a community forum where people can talk and share experiences and opinions.
We also came up with the idea of including an online consultation portal where patients can consult with a healthcare provider from the comfort of their homes.



### Note:
**Incase the application demo doesn't start real quick, you can get an idea about how it looks like from the screenshots**
